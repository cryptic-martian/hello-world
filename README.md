# hello-world

Yo, Cryptic Martian here! Or simply Cryptic, whichever you prefer. Welcome to the visualisation of my crazy mind.

This repository isn't composed of anything interesting yet. I'm currently learning how GitHub works. From what I've read, it's great for collaboration, and that's exactly why I'm here.

Recently, I've been welcomed to an ambitious Minecraft project. This is the place I decided to store our ideas, documentation, and code, to keep it safe, and ease the team work.
